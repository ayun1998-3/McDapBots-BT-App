# Gamepad API Demo

This app is a Next.js based implementation of the Browser Standard [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API) and is best viewed in a WebKit-based browser.

It will work out of the box with most game controllers, with icons for PS4 and Nintendo Switch Pro controllers.

## Getting Started

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000
to view the app.
